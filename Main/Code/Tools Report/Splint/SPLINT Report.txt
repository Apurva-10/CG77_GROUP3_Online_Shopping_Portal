Splint 3.1.2 --- 21 Feb 2021

function.c:5: Include file <termios.h> matches the name of a POSIX library, but
    the POSIX library is not being used.  Consider using +posixlib or
    +posixstrictlib to select the POSIX library, or -warnposix to suppress this
    message.
  Header name matches a POSIX header, but the POSIX library is not selected.
  (Use -warnposixheaders to inhibit warning)
< Location unknown >: Field name reused:
  Code cannot be parsed.  For help on parse errors, see splint -help
  parseerrors. (Use -syntax to inhibit warning)
< Location unknown >: Previous use of
function.c: (in function customer_to_list)
function.c:12:35: Variable ptr shadows outer declaration
  An outer declaration is shadowed by the local declaration. (Use -shadow to
  inhibit warning)
   func.h:37:23: Previous definition of ptr: cst *
function.c:20:8: Possibly null storage new_cust passed as non-null param:
                    fread (new_cust, ...)
  A possibly null pointer is passed as a parameter corresponding to a formal
  parameter with no /*@null@*/ annotation.  If NULL may be used for this
  parameter, add a /*@null@*/ annotation to the function parameter declaration.
  (Use -nullpass to inhibit warning)
   function.c:19:11: Storage new_cust may become null
function.c:20:2: Return value (type size_t) ignored: fread(new_cust, ...
  Result returned by function call is not used. If this is intended, can cast
  result to (void) to eliminate message. (Use -retvalother to inhibit warning)
function.c:21:9: Operand of ! is non-boolean (int): !feof(fp)
  The operand of a boolean operator is not a boolean. Use +ptrnegate to allow !
  to be used on pointers. (Use -boolops to inhibit warning)
function.c:30:8: Arrow access from null pointer last: last->next
  A possibly null pointer is dereferenced.  Value is either the result of a
  function which may return null (in which case, code should check it is not
  null), or a global, parameter or structure field declared with the null
  qualifier. (Use -nullderef to inhibit warning)
   function.c:13:9: Storage last becomes null
function.c:30:4: Implicitly only storage last->next (type struct customer *)
                    not released before assignment: last->next = new_cust
  A memory leak has been detected. Only-qualified storage is not released
  before the last reference to it is lost. (Use -mustfreeonly to inhibit
  warning)
function.c:35:9: Possibly null storage new_cust passed as non-null param:
                    fread (new_cust, ...)
   function.c:34:12: Storage new_cust may become null
function.c:35:3: Return value (type size_t) ignored: fread(new_cust, ...
function.c:37:2: Path with no return in function declared to return int
  There is a path through a function declared to return a value on which there
  is no return statement. This means the execution may fall through without
  returning a meaningful result to the caller. (Use -noret to inhibit warning)
function.c:37:2: Fresh storage new_cust not released before return
  A memory leak has been detected. Storage allocated locally is not released
  before the last reference to it is lost. (Use -mustfreefresh to inhibit
  warning)
   function.c:19:2: Fresh storage new_cust created
function.c: (in function list_to_customer)
function.c:40:19: Variable ptr shadows outer declaration
   func.h:37:23: Previous definition of ptr: cst *

                     fwrite (..., fp)
   function.c:46:5: Storage fp may become null
function.c:49:3: Return value (type size_t) ignored: fwrite(ptr, size...
function.c:51:9: Possibly null storage fp passed as non-null param: fclose (fp)
   function.c:46:5: Storage fp may become null
function.c:51:2: Return value (type int) ignored: fclose(fp)
  Result returned by function call is not used. If this is intended, can cast
  result to (void) to eliminate message. (Use -retvalint to inhibit warning)
function.c:52:2: Path with no return in function declared to return int
function.c: (in function stock_to_list)
function.c:56:32: Variable ptr1 shadows outer declaration
   func.h:38:25: Previous definition of ptr1: stok *
function.c:63:8: Possibly null storage new_stk passed as non-null param:
                    fread (new_stk, ...)
   function.c:62:10: Storage new_stk may become null
function.c:63:2: Return value (type size_t) ignored: fread(new_stk, s...
function.c:64:9: Operand of ! is non-boolean (int): !feof(fp1)
function.c:73:4: Variable last1 used before definition
  An rvalue is used that may not be initialized to a value on some execution
  path. (Use -usedef to inhibit warning)
function.c:73:4: Implicitly only storage last1->next (type struct stock *) not
                    released before assignment: last1->next = new_stk
function.c:78:9: Possibly null storage new_stk passed as non-null param:
                    fread (new_stk, ...)
   function.c:77:11: Storage new_stk may become null

function.c:80:2: Path with no return in function declared to return int
function.c:80:2: Fresh storage new_stk not released before return
   function.c:62:2: Fresh storage new_stk created
function.c:56:32: Variable ptr1 declared but not used
  A variable is declared but never used. Use /*@unused@*/ in front of
  declaration to suppress message. (Use -varuse to inhibit warning)
function.c: (in function list_to_stock)
function.c:83:16: Variable ptr1 shadows outer declaration
   func.h:38:25: Previous definition of ptr1: stok *
function.c:92:38: Possibly null storage fp1 passed as non-null param:
                     fwrite (..., fp1)

  warning)
function.c:104:15: Passed storage pass not completely defined (*pass is
                      undefined): strcmp (pass, ...)
  Storage derivable from a parameter, return value or global is not defined.
  Use /*@out@*/ to denote passed or returned storage which need not be defined.
  (Use -compdef to inhibit warning)
function.c:104:8: Test expression for if not boolean, type int:
                     strcmp(pass, "gs3osp")
  Test expression type is not boolean or int. (Use -predboolint to inhibit
  warning)
